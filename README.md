Image Classification Task for ML Internship 2023

Constraints:

- The current solution uses a relatively simple model architecture and may not perform well on more complex datasets with a larger number of classes or more diverse image characteristics.
- The current solution only uses basic data augmentation techniques, which may not be sufficient for more complex datasets where more advanced augmentation techniques can be used.
- The current solution assumes that all images in each folder belong to the same class. This may not be true in all cases, leading to misclassifications.
- The current solution only evaluates the model's performance on a single test dataset. Additional evaluation methods, such as cross-validation, could be used to provide a more accurate assessment of the model's performance.

Potential improvements:

- Experiment with more complex model architectures to improve performance on more complex datasets.
- Explore more advanced data augmentation techniques, such as GAN-based augmentation, to increase the diversity of the training data.
- Implement a mechanism to handle images that belong to multiple classes, such as using multi-label classification or object detection techniques.
- Use cross-validation or other evaluation methods to provide a more accurate assessment of the model's performance.
- Implement early stopping to prevent overfitting during training.
- Use transfer learning by starting with a pre-trained model, such as VGG or ResNet, to improve performance and reduce training time.
- Implement hyperparameter tuning to optimize model performance.
